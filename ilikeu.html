                            I just wanted you to know that I really like you. I like talking to you although i got nothing much to say. I like listening to your silly stories. I like asking you questions just to keep the conversation going. I like to know how your day went. I like our phone calls. I like being weird with you. I like to know you better.
                            <br/><br/>

                            I miss you so much pogi.
